Enex2md is a Python based command-line utility to convert Evernote export files (`*.enex`) to [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is unmaintained/archived (since July 2024).
> I wrapped up my migration from Evernote to Obsidian
> and I no longer intend to continue working on this tool.


> [!NOTE]
> This is a friendly fork of [@janik6n's original enex2md tool](https://github.com/janik6n/enex2md) (which is now in archive mode).
> At the moment I'm just interested in massaging it to support my own needs:
> migrating as cleanly as possible from Evernote to Obsidian.
> I'll probably break backward compatibility with the original project at some point.


## Features

In addition to the note content itself, the note metadata is included in the resulting Markdown. The ENEX-bundle may contain one or more notes.

Within the note content, the following features are supported:

- [x] Strong and emphasis text styles.
- [x] Ordered (i.e. numbered) and unordered lists
- [x] Tables created within Evernote are converted to [GFM Tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#table)
- [x] Tasks are converted to [GFM Task list items](https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-item)
- [x] Images and other attachments
- [x] Code blocks
- [x] Subsequent empty lines are compressed to one.

The HTML in ENEX files is *somewhat interesting*, thus some *magic is used to massage the data to functioning feature-rich Markdown*. The Magic Book used here has not yet been fully written, so there might be some unfortunate side effects.

See [Changelog](https://github.com/soxofaan/enex2md/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.
